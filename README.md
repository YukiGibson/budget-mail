### Budget Email parser

Current bank applications gives you charts about your spending. I would like to instead of dealing with that, which it's not that good to begin with, I want to have the data myself and do whatever I want with it.

The goal is to consume emails sent from my own spending, parse them, and build a budget from that. This tracks well because my mail accounts from which I will use this, receives all notifications from several banks either it's a deposit, credit card payment, withdrawal, etc...

Another motivation is for fun, I have many ideas I want to apply freely to this project, which will benefit me in the long run if the main idea work: A better money management tool for myself... I hate every budget tracking App I have used so far because, I not only have to setup my goals, I have to add every single spending I have, and sometimes it snowballs out of control when I have to add several days, weeks or months. And I just end up not doing anything. Hopefully this fixes that.
